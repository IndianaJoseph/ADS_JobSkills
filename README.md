# ADS_NextCareer
This project is intended to allow users to explore the skill ratings of their current job and identity other careers with related skills. The project sought to answer the research questions: What are the known skills for each occupation? What are related careers that a person might consider pursuing?"

The project included three data science tasks. The first task was data wrangling and exploratory analysis. The second task was clustering. The third task was data visualization. This shiny app is a result of those three tasks.
 
The data used in this project is from O*Net and is available at https://www.onetcenter.org/database.html
